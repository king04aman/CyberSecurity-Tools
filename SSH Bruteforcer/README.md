# SSH Password Brute Force
*This is a Python script that performs SSH password brute force attack. The script reads a list of passwords from a text file, and then tries each password against a target SSH server until a successful login occurs or all passwords have been tried.*

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssh-brute-force.git
```
- Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install paramiko
```

## Usage
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
- Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python ssh_brute_force.py
```

- Enter the target IP address, username, and location of the password file when prompted.
- The script will then attempt to log in to the target SSH server using the passwords in the specified file.
