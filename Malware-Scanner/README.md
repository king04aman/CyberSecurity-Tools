# Malware Scanner

This Python script scans directories for malicious files by calculating their hashes (MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256) and comparing them against a list of known malicious hashes. It classifies detected malware types and displays the results in a structured table format.

## Features

- Calculates MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes for files.
- Compares file hashes against a predefined list of malicious hashes.
- Classifies malware into various types such as Ransomware, Trojan, Virus, etc.
- Displays results in a user-friendly table format.
- Supports scanning multiple directories based on the operating system.

## Requirements

To run this script, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `requests`
- `prettytable`

You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install requests prettytable
```

## Usage

1. **Download the Script**: Clone or download this repository.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script with Python. The script will automatically scan predefined directories based on your operating system.

   ```bash
   python malware_scanner.py
   ```

3. **View Output**: The script will display a table with the paths of detected malicious files and their corresponding hazard types. It also shows the total number of scanned files and the execution time.

## Code Explanation

- **Hash Calculation**: The script calculates the hashes for each file using the `hashlib` library.
  
- **Malware Classification**: It checks if the calculated hashes match any known malicious hashes stored in a remote `hashes.txt` file.

- **Directory Scanning**: The script scans through specified directories, handling permission errors gracefully.

- **PrettyTable**: Results are formatted in a readable table using the `prettytable` library.

## Supported Operating Systems

- **Windows**: Scans default directories such as `C:\`, `D:\`, and `E:\`.
- **Linux**: Scans directories like `/usr`, `/home`, and `/`.

## Limitations

- The script requires internet access to download the `hashes.txt` file.
- Scanning large directories may take a significant amount of time depending on the number of files and system performance.
- Permission errors may occur if the script tries to access restricted files.
